                Hi, I am a Web Developer. I love to code and learn new things. For the past 2.6 years I worked as 
                Business Development Executive in a small business in my Hometown. I have been coding since the 3rd year
                of my college. My past work experience along with the web development skills helps me understand my client's
                vision and deliver the project with more detail that aligns with the vision of my client business.
            </p>
